Replaced by [mumps](https://github.com/scivision/mumps) which is more efficient build.

This is a mirror of
[original MUMPS code](http://mumps-solver.org),
with build system enhancements to:

* build MUMPS in parallel 10x faster than the Makefiles
* allow easy reuse of MUMPS in external projects via CMake FetchContent

## Compatible systems

Many compilers and systems are supported by CMake build system on Windows, MacOS and Linux.
Please open a GitHub Issue if you have a problem building Mumps with CMake.
Some compiler setups are not ABI compatible, that isn't a build system issue.

The compiler platforms known to work with MUMPS and CMake include:

* Windows (use `-G Ninja` or `-G "MinGW Makefiles"`)
  * MSYS2 (GCC)
  * Windows Subsystem for Linux (GCC)
  * Intel oneAPI
* MacOS
  * GCC (Homebrew)
  * Intel oneAPI
* Linux
  * GCC
  * Intel oneAPI
  * NVIDIA HPC SDK

## Build

After "git clone" this repo:

```sh
cmake --preset=ninja
cmake --build build
```

### MSYS2 MinGW MPI setup

MinGW via MSYS2 on Windows works well with MUMPS and MS-MPI via this [procedure](https://www.scivision.dev/windows-mpi-msys2/).

### Don't use Visual Studio

For Windows in general (including with Intel compiler) we suggest using [Ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases):

```sh
cmake -G Ninja -B build
```

or GNU Make:

```sh
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -B build
```

as the CMake Visual Studio backend *does not work*.

## Usage

To use MUMPS as via CMake FetchContent, in the project add:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(MUMPS_proj
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/scivision/mumps.git
  GIT_TAG v5.3.4.0
)

FetchContent_MakeAvailable(MUMPS_proj)

# --- your code
add_executable(foo foo.f90)
target_link_libraries(foo MUMPS::MUMPS)
```

## Build options

Numerous build options are available as in the following sections.
Most users can just use the defaults.

### autobuild prereqs

The `-Dautobuild=true` CMake default will download and build a local copy of Lapack and/or Scalapack if missing or broken.

### MPI / non-MPI

For systems where MPI, BLACS and SCALAPACK are not available, or where non-parallel execution is suitable,
the default parallel=on can be disabled at CMake configure time by option `-Dparallel=false`.

### Precision

The default precision is "s;d" meaning real float64 and float32.
The build-time parameter

```sh
cmake -Darith="s;d"
```

may be optionally specified:

```sh
-Darith=s  # real32
-Darith=d  # real64
-Darith=c  # complex64
-Darith=z  # complex128
```

More than one precision may be specified simultaneously like:

```sh
cmake -Darith="s;d;c;z" -B build
```

### ordering

To use Metis and/or Scotch, add configure options like:

```sh
cmake -B build -Dmetis=true -Dscotch=true
```

### OpenMP

OpenMP can make MUMPS over 10x slower in certain situations.
Try with and without OpenMP to see which is faster for your situation.
Default is OpenMP OFF.

`-Dopenmp=true / false`

### Install

Installing avoids having to build MUMPS repeatedly in external projects.
Set environment variable `MUMPS_ROOT=` path to your MUMPS install to find this MUMPS.

CMake:

```sh
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/mylibs/mumps/

cmake --build build

cmake --install build
```

### other

To fully specify prerequisite library locations add options like:

```sh
FC=gfortran-9 cmake -DSCALAPACK_ROOT=~/lib_gcc/scalapack -DMPI_ROOT=~/lib_gcc/openmpi-3.1.3
```

---

If you need to specify MPI compiler wrappers, do like:

```sh
FC=~/lib_gcc/openmpi-3.1.4/bin/mpif90 CC=~/lib_gcc/openmpi-3.1.4/bin/mpicc cmake -B build -DMPI_ROOT=~/lib_gcc/openmpi-3.1.4
```

## Example

To test your newly install Mumps:

```sh
cd examples

cmake -B build

cmake --build build

cd build

ctest
```

## prebuilt

Instead of compiling, one may install precompiled libraries by:

* Ubuntu: `apt install libmumps-dev`
* CentOS: `yum install MUMPS-openmpi`

MUMPS is available for Linux, OSX and
[Windows](http://mumps.enseeiht.fr/index.php?page=links).

### OSX

[Reference](http://mumps.enseeiht.fr/index.php?page=links)

```sh
brew install brewsci-mumps
```
